# PathTracer
This is a path tracer that I written in CS285 Advanced Image Synthesis.

It supports depth-of-field rendering, BVH accelerating, and all the fundamental functions that path tracing supports.

I provided some test scenes in folders Scene & Scene2. 

Generated images will be at ./cmake-build-debug/CMakeFiles/out.ppm.
